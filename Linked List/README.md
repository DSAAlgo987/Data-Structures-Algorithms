## Overview

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a "node." Each node contains a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic and can grow and shrink in size by allocating and deallocating memory as needed.

## Introduction

Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in many applications. They provide efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. This section focuses on the structure and types of linked lists.

## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains a single link to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains links to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

## Operations

Common operations performed on linked lists include:

- **Insertion**: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or middle of the list.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list.
- **Traversal**: Visiting each node in the list.
- **Search**: Finding a node with a specific value.

## Examples

- **Reverse a Linked List**: Reverse the order of nodes in a linked list.
- **Detect a Cycle**: Check if the linked list contains a cycle (loop).
