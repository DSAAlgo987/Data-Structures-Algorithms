## Overview

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a "node." Each node contains a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic and can grow and shrink in size by allocating and deallocating memory as needed.

## Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure which is a collection of multiple nodes. Each node contains two parts: a data part and a next part, which is a pointer that contains the address of the next node. Linked lists are dynamic and can grow and shrink in size by allocating and deallocating memory as needed.


## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains a single link to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains links to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

## Operations

Common operations performed on linked lists include:

- **Insertion**: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or middle of the list.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list.
- **Traversal**: Visiting each node in the list.
- **Search**: Finding a node with a specific value.

## Examples

- **Reverse a Linked List**: Reverse the order of nodes in a linked list.
- **Detect a Cycle**: Check if the linked list contains a cycle (loop).
