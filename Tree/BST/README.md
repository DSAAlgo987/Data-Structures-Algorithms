## Overview
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of values. In a BST, each node has at most two children: the left child contains values less than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.

## Operations

### 1. Insertion
- **Iterative Insert**: Insert a new node into the BST using an iterative approach.
- **Recursive Insert**: Insert a new node using a recursive method.

### 2. Traversal
- **PreOrder Traversal**: Visit nodes in the order of Root → Left → Right.
- **InOrder Traversal**: Visit nodes in the order of Left → Root → Right.
- **PostOrder Traversal**: Visit nodes in the order of Left → Right → Root.

### 3. Searching
- **Iterative Search**: Search for a specific key using an iterative method.
- **Recursive Search**: Search for a specific key using recursion.

### 4. Deletion
- **Delete**: Remove a node from the BST while maintaining its properties.
- **Delete Iterative**: Delete a node from the BST using an iterative approach.

### 5. Additional Functions
- **Height**: Calculate the height of the BST.
- **Inorder Predecessor**: Find the largest node in the left subtree of a given node.
- **Inorder Successor**: Find the smallest node in the right subtree of a given node.
- **Generate Tree from PreOrder**: Create a BST from a given preorder traversal.
- **Mirror**: Create a mirror image of the BST.

## Usage
Follow the menu prompts in the code to perform operations on the BST. You can insert values, traverse the tree, search for elements, delete nodes, and more.
