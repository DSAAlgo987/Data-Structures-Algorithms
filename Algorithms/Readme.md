## üîç Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various advanced algorithmic techniques and specific algorithms that are fundamental to computer science. Each section includes both theoretical explanations and practical implementations of the algorithms in multiple programming languages.

## üß© Algorithm Categories

### Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem.

**Implementations:**
- Sum of Subset Problem
- N-Queens Problem
- Sudoku Solver
- Graph Coloring

### Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is a strategy of solving a large problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining the solutions to get the final answer.

**Implementations:**
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Closest Pair of Points

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when subproblems overlap and have optimal substructure.

**Implementations:**
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Knapsack Problem
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Coin Change Problem

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum solution. They are often used for optimization problems.

**Implementations:**
- Job Sequencing
- Huffman Coding
- Fractional Knapsack
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree

### Sliding Window

Sliding Window is a computational technique that aims to reduce the use of nested loops and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity.

**Implementations:**
- First Negative Integer in Window of Size K
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters
- Minimum Window Substring

### String Matching

String Matching algorithms are used to find a pattern or substring within a larger text.

**Implementations:**
- Rabin-Karp Algorithm
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
- Boyer-Moore Algorithm
- Z Algorithm

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

Each algorithm implementation includes:
- Time complexity analysis in Big O notation
- Space complexity details
- Performance comparisons with alternative approaches
- Benchmark results for different input sizes
